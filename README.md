# 2D Gaze Tracking for Breakout Game Control

This project implements a **2D Gaze Tracking** system that uses appearance-based methods to control the paddle in the **Breakout** game. The system tracks the user's gaze and moves the paddle based on their eye position, providing a unique and engaging way to interact with the game.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **OpenCV**: Used for capturing video feed and processing the gaze data.
- **Dlib**: Facial landmark detection for gaze tracking.
- **PyGame**: Framework for creating the Breakout game.
- **NumPy**: For efficient array manipulation and calculations.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional)**: If deep learning-based gaze tracking is implemented.

## Project Structure


## Features

- **Real-Time Eye Gaze Tracking**: Tracks the userâ€™s eye position using their webcam.
- **Breakout Game Control**: The paddle moves based on the user's gaze in the game.
- **Appearance-Based Gaze Detection**: The system uses computer vision techniques to detect and interpret gaze direction.
