# 2D Gaze Tracking for Breakout Game Control

This project implements a **2D Gaze Tracking** system that uses appearance-based methods to control the paddle in the **Breakout** game. The system tracks the user's gaze and moves the paddle based on their eye position, providing a unique and engaging way to interact with the game.


## Project Structure


## Features

- **Real-Time Eye Gaze Tracking**: Tracks the userâ€™s eye position using their webcam.
- **Breakout Game Control**: The paddle moves based on the user's gaze in the game.
- **Appearance-Based Gaze Detection**: The system uses computer vision techniques to detect and interpret gaze direction.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed. You can check this by running:

```bash
python --version```

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2D-Gaze-Tracking-Breakout.git
cd 2D-Gaze-Tracking-Breakout

pip install -r requirements.txt
